# LyricTextMiningAnalysis
Junior year text mining abroad class final project: Analyzed the Billboard Hot 100 songs from 1964-2015 using three text mining techniques in the hopes of finding a link between annual sentiments, common topics, and current events in popular music

1: Sentiment Analysis: Each song was assigned a sentiment score from -1 to 1, negative to positive. Then, the sentiments of the top 100 songs from each year were averaged together to get an annual sentiment score.

2: LDA Topic Modeling: Half of the songs from each year were randomly selected and analyzed to create a set of topics. The other half of the songs from each year were then divided into one of these topics.

3: Named Entity Recognition: Looking at the annual topic with the most songs, the top 3 most frequently used nouns were selected from each song in the topic.

While it would have been great to find a concrete link between annual sentiments/popular topics and current events, most songs were about common popular music topics like love, sex, and relationships.
